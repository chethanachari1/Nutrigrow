### NutriGrow 

Our project aims to improve child healthcare by developing a user-friendly tool for malnutrition detection and personalized diet recommendations. By analyzing a childâ€™s height and weight, the system determines their nutritional status and suggests tailored diet plans based on age-specific requirements.  

The application features a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built using Java Swing, ensuring easy interaction for healthcare providers, parents, and caregivers. Apache POI libraries facilitate seamless extraction of nutritional data from Excel spreadsheets, streamlining the detection process. With carefully implemented tolerance thresholds and distinct diet plans for various age groups, the system ensures accuracy and relevance in its recommendations.  

A key strength of our project is its focus on practical, balanced diets that incorporate locally available foods to address malnutrition effectively. While our tool successfully meets its primary objectives, future enhancements could include expanding the nutritional database, integrating interactive educational content, and developing a mobile application to broaden accessibility.  

This initiative represents a step forward in leveraging technology to combat malnutrition, providing a scalable foundation for future advancements in child healthcare.
